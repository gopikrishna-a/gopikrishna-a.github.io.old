Hi There, In this post we'll see some Interview questions on Python programming language

**1. What is Python?**

+ Python is an example of a high-level language similar to Other high-level languages Ex:  C, C++, Perl, and Java
+ programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of
high-level languages.
+ Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an interpreter. 

**2. What is low-level language?**

+ A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute.
+ low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages.
+ computers can only run programs written in lowlevel languages. 

**3. How high-level languages process  into low-level languages?**

+ Interpreters and compilers process high-level languages into low-level languages. 

**4. What is An interpreter?**

+ An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
+ An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it
+ It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations

	`SOURCE CODE` --->  `INTERPRETER` ---> `OUTPUT`

**5. What is a compiler?**

+ A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running.  In this context, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation

    
    `SOURCE CODE` --->  `COMPILER` ---> `OBJECT CODE` ---> `EXECUTOR` ---> `OUTPUT`

**6. What is a program?**

+ A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. 

**7. What is debugging?**

+ Programming is error-prone. Programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down is called debugging.


**8. Three kinds of errors can occur in a program?**

+ Syntax errors
+ Runtime errors
+ Semantic errors
